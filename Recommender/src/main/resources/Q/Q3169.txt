 question  ,  null,  i  have  a  system  which  break  a  larg  tak  into  small  task  use  about  thread  as  a  time  as  each  individu  thread  finish  it  persist  it  calcul  result  to  the  databas  what  i  want  to  achiev  is  to  have  each  thread  pass  it  result  to  a  new  persis  class  that  will  perform  a  type  of  doubl  buffer  and  data  persist  while  run  in  it  own  threadfor  exampl  after  thread  have  move  their  data  to  the  buffer  the  persist  class  then  the  persist  class  swap  the  buffer  and  persist  all  entri  to  the  databas  this  would  allow  util  of  prepar  statement  and  thus  cut  way  down  on  the  io  between  the  program  and  the  databas  is  there  a  pattern  or  good  exampl  of  this  type  of  multithread  doubl  buffer  ,    classdefinit  instancefield  simplevari  staticfieldspecifi  classfield  simpleassignmentexpress  objectcreationstat  constructorcal  actualmethodparamet  objectmethodinvoc  constructordefinit  publicconstructorspecifi  genericobjectcreationstat  formalmethodparamet  methoddefinit  publicmethodspecifi  voiddatatyp  ifstat  greaterexpress  extendsspecif  whilestat  true  foreachstat
