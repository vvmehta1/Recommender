 question  ,  null,  ive  been  tri  to  understand  reentrant  lock  and  semaphor  the  nest  of  reentrant  lock  vs  releaseunlock  mechan  it  seem  that  have  a  semaphor  requir  you  to  write  a  more  thorough  test  applic  becaus  the  releas  method  doe  not  check  if  the  thread  releas  the  permit  is  actual  hold  it  when  i  test  my  test  code  i  found  out  that  this  may  subsequ  increas  the  number  of  permit  beyond  the  initi  limit  on  the  other  hand  if  a  thread  is  not  hold  a  reentrant  lock  when  it  invok  the  unlock  method  we  get  an  illegalmonitorexcept  so  would  it  be  right  to  say  that  there  is  no  real  reason  ever  to  have  a  binari  semaphor  as  everyth  that  a  binari  semaphor  can  do  can  also  be  done  by  a  reentrantlock  if  we  use  binari  semaphor  we  would  have  to  check  the  entir  method  call  stack  to  see  if  a  permit  was  acquir  befor  also  was  it  releas  too  if  there  is  a  possibl  of  a  subsequ  acquir  which  might  block  if  a  releas  doe  not  proceed  it  and  so  on  also  sinc  reentrant  lock  also  provid  one  lock  per  object  isnt  it  alway  a  better  idea  to  prefer  a  reentrant  lock  to  a  binari  semaphor  i  have  check  a  post  here  that  talk  about  differ  between  a  binari  semaphor  and  a  mutex  but  is  there  a  thing  like  a  mutex  in  java  thankschan  ps  i  had  post  this  question  in  anoth  forum  and  i  havent  receiv  a  respons  yet  i  thought  id  post  it  here  as  well  to  see  what  i  can  get  ,
