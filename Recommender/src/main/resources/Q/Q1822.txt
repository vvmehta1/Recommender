 question  ,  injector.injectmembers();  public  interface  injectable  {void  injectall(injector  injector);};  public  void  injectall(injector  injector)  {injector.injectmembers(this);for  (injectable  child  :  children)child.injectall(injector);};  mainwindow.injectall(injector)  ,i  have  an  exist  object  hierarchi  where  some  object  have  field  that  need  to  be  inject  also  there  are  some  other  object  that  are  construct  use  and  need  to  be  inject  with  refer  to  some  object  from  previous  describ  object  hierarchi  how  do  i  do  such  kind  of  inject  with  guic  the  problem  is  that  object  from  exist  hierarchi  were  not  construct  use  guic  and  therefor  are  not  subject  to  inject  process  by  default  there  is  of  cours  method  that  is  abl  to  inject  into  exist  object  instanc  but  it  doe  not  work  on  object  hierarchi  for  those  wonder  whi  i  cant  build  mention  object  hierarchi  use  guic  this  hierarchi  repres  gui  object  and  is  built  by  a  gui  framework  from  a  declar  gui  descript  in  fact  this  process  can  be  describ  as  object  deseri  that  way  interfac  construct  is  rather  simpl  and  i  onli  want  to  inject  certain  servic  refer  into  interfac  object  and  vice  versa  for  callback  approach  i  am  current  about  to  take  is  describ  belowfor  inject  into  preexist  object  hierarchi  just  let  all  object  that  are  interest  in  inject  implement  certain  interfac  like  those  object  would  then  implement  this  interfac  like  so  then  id  just  call  for  root  object  in  hierarchi  and  all  object  of  interest  are  inject  not  veri  nice  solut  but  get  the  work  done  on  one  side  on  the  other  side  i  need  to  inject  object  from  this  hierarchi  i  guess  it  can  be  done  via  implement  custom  provid  for  such  object  is  there  a  better  solut  to  my  problem  mayb  there  is  also  someth  wrong  with  my  approach  ,  classdefinit  interfacedefinit  publicinterfacespecifi  formalmethodparamet  methoddefinit  abstractmethoddefinit  voiddatatyp  publicmethodspecifi  objectmethodinvoc  actualmethodparamet  foreachstat    simplevari  instancefield  constructordefinit  formalmethodparamet  instancefieldinvoc  thisrefer  simpleassignmentexpress  objectmethodinvoc  actualmethodparamet
