 question  ,  null,  i  have  a  java  program  for  do  a  set  of  scientif  calcul  across  multipl  processor  by  break  it  into  piec  and  run  each  piec  in  a  differ  thread  the  problem  is  trivial  partition  so  there  no  content  or  communic  between  the  threadsth  onli  common  data  they  access  are  some  share  static  cach  that  dont  need  to  have  their  access  synchron  and  some  data  file  on  the  hard  drive  the  thread  are  also  continu  write  to  the  disk  but  to  separ  file  my  problem  is  that  sometim  when  i  run  the  program  i  get  veri  good  speed  and  sometim  when  i  run  the  exact  same  thing  it  run  veri  slowlyif  i  see  it  run  slowli  and  ctrlc  and  restart  it  it  will  usual  start  run  fast  againit  seem  to  set  itself  into  either  slow  mode  or  fast  mode  earli  on  in  the  run  and  never  switch  between  mode  i  have  hook  it  up  to  jconsol  and  it  doesnt  seem  to  be  a  memori  problemwhen  i  have  caught  it  run  slowli  ive  tri  connect  a  profil  to  it  but  the  profil  wont  connect  tri  run  with  xprof  but  the  dump  between  a  slow  run  and  fast  run  dont  seem  to  be  much  differenti  have  tri  use  differ  garbag  collector  and  differ  size  of  the  various  part  of  the  memori  space  also  my  machin  is  a  mac  pro  with  stripe  raid  partitionth  cpu  usag  never  drop  off  whether  it  run  slowli  or  quick  which  you  would  expect  if  thread  were  spend  too  much  time  block  on  read  from  the  disk  so  i  dont  think  it  could  be  a  disk  read  problem  my  question  is  what  type  of  problem  with  my  code  could  caus  thisor  could  this  be  an  os  problem  i  havent  been  abl  to  duplic  it  on  a  window  a  machin  but  i  dont  have  a  window  machin  with  a  similar  raid  setup  ,
