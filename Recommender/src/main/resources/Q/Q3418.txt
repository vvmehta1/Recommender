 question  ,  preparedstatement;  linkedblockingqueue  ,im  work  on  a  javabas  server  in  which  i  will  have  multipl  thread  one  thread  for  each  connect  user  some  extra  there  will  be  some  databas  connect  involv  so  i  was  think  that  each  time  the  server  make  a  queri  to  the  databas  it  will  start  a  new  thread  for  this  to  prevent  block  from  the  current  thread  im  plan  on  use  a  connect  pool  for  this  and  i  think  i  know  how  to  do  that  ive  look  into  howev  there  will  be  a  lot  of  statement  involv  also  but  it  not  import  that  these  are  ran  direct  it  ok  with  a  delay  here  and  sinc  there  might  be  a  lot  of  statement  im  think  of  have  a  singl  worker  thread  for  all  statement  as  i  see  it  this  will  have  the  advantag  of  be  abl  to  reuseobject  how  can  i  from  the  other  thread  tell  thework  thread  to  run  some  statement  i  know  about  multithread  and  how  to  make  thread  talk  to  each  other  use  synchron  block  but  with  the  databas  involv  it  sudden  feel  more  complex  i  have  read  that  prepar  statement  and  connect  should  not  be  share  between  threadsdoesnt  feel  like  a  good  solut  use  a  or  anoth  kind  of  queue  of  a  custom  class  with  inform  about  which  kind  of  updat  statement  to  call  and  which  paramet  to  send  it  and  then  the  worker  thread  will  read  from  this  queue  when  it  notifi  which  it  will  be  when  someth  is  ad  to  the  queue  and  there  it  will  run  the  appropri  method  which  will  use  the  appropri  prepar  statement  set  the  param  and  call  ita  bad  think  that  i  see  myself  with  this  approach  is  that  the  param  might  be  int  string  doubl  or  whatev  how  to  store  them  in  the  custom  class  doesnt  feel  good  to  store  them  all  as  string  am  i  on  the  right  track  here  or  is  there  a  better  way  to  solv  this  ,  simpleassignmentexpress
