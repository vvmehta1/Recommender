 question  ,  binarysearch(  object  o  );;  comparable;  implements  ,mi  method  take  as  input  an  object  how  do  i  determin  it  type  then  cast  it  accord  so  for  exampleinsid  the  binarysearch  method  i  need  a  way  to  determin  the  type  or  class  of  object  o  then  i  need  to  cast  it  with  that  type  how  would  i  do  that  and  more  specif  object  o  is  a  child  of  a  base  class  eg  salariedemp  is  child  of  employe  and  i  specif  need  the  base  class  editi  figur  out  how  to  do  what  i  want  which  realli  should  be  a  complet  differ  question  i  need  to  use  the  compareto  method  from  to  set  up  a  way  to  compar  two  object  base  on  privat  data  from  those  object  all  i  had  to  do  was  implement  my  class  as  compar  use  the  keyword  so  no  matter  what  type  of  object  are  compar  in  my  binarysearch  method  it  work  if  they  are  of  the  same  unknown  type  and  have  compar  implement  this  make  my  binarysearch  method  veri  reusabl  with  ani  type  of  compar  class  so  in  all  fair  ill  accept  the  answer  that  cover  the  origin  question  ,  actualmethodparamet    ifstat  actualmethodparamet  explicittypecast     simpleassignmentexpress
