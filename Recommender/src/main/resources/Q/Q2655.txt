 question  ,  "threadpoolexecutor;  threadfactory;  threadpoolexecutor;  threadpoolexecutor;  thread.getcurrentthread().getname();  thread.currentthread().setname(  ""my  runnable  name""  );"  ,im  use  a  in  java  to  manag  a  lot  of  run  thread  ive  creat  my  own  simpl  so  i  can  give  the  thread  better  name  the  issu  is  that  the  name  get  set  in  the  thread  when  the  thread  pool  is  first  creat  and  is  not  tie  to  the  task  that  the  thread  pool  is  actual  run  i  understand  this  my  runnabl  and  callablesthough  they  have  namesar  actual  one  level  of  abstract  down  from  thes  run  thread  there  have  been  some  other  question  on  stackoverflow  about  creat  name  for  thread  pool  see  and  what  i  want  to  know  is  doe  anyon  have  a  good  solut  for  keep  the  name  of  the  thread  pool  thread  in  sync  with  the  runnabl  that  it  is  actual  run  ie  if  i  call  id  like  it  to  return  the  name  of  the  toplevel  thread  pool  but  rather  the  name  of  the  callablerunn  that  the  thread  is  current  run  sinc  this  is  main  for  debug  and  log  purpos  im  tri  to  avoid  a  solut  that  involv  me  put  new  code  into  everi  runnabl  that  might  be  submit  to  the  threadpoolexecutorid  rather  just  put  some  code  into  the  threadfactori  or  wrap  the  threadpoolexecutor  itself  so  that  the  chang  is  done  in  one  place  if  such  a  solut  doesnt  exist  i  probabl  wont  bother  sinc  it  not  mission  criticalto  clarifi  i  know  i  can  put  a  as  the  first  line  of  everi  runnabl  run  method  but  im  tri  to  avoid  do  that  im  be  a  perfectionist  here  and  i  realiz  it  so  i  wont  be  offend  if  peopl  want  to  comment  on  this  question  and  tell  me  somi  other  question  i  suppos  is  whether  peopl  think  it  a  bad  idea  to  do  such  a  thing  should  i  be  wari  of  updat  the  thread  pool  name  like  this  thank  for  ani  suggest  ,
