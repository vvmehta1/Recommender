 question  ,  null,  i  am  current  use  java  ive  read  a  lot  about  erlang  on  the  net  and  i  have  big  question  i  have  read  about  the  number  of  processor  in  most  machin  go  up  and  thread  model  be  hard  i  agre  but  i  am  look  to  find  out  when  the  line  is  go  to  be  cross  so  that  i  can  chang  languageparadigm  at  the  right  time  i  am  work  serversid  on  java  servic  which  are  veri  cpubound  and  easili  made  parallel  this  is  due  to  typic  a  singl  incom  updat  via  tcp  trigger  a  chang  to  multipl  s  of  output  the  calcul  are  typic  pretti  simpl  few  loop  just  lot  of  arithmet  and  the  input  are  come  in  pretti  fast  s  current  we  are  run  on  cpu  machin  and  run  multipl  servic  on  each  so  multithread  is  pretti  pointless  and  java  seem  to  run  faster  without  the  sync  block  etc  requir  to  make  it  multithread  there  is  now  a  strong  push  for  speed  and  we  now  have  access  to  processor  machin  per  process  if  requir  so  i  am  wonder  how  best  to  proceed  massiv  multithread  java  or  someth  easier  to  code  like  erlang  ,
