 question  ,  null,  ive  been  execut  some  test  on  android  in  order  to  verifi  how  good  the  perform  of  an  algorithm  like  fft  can  be  improv  if  it  is  parallel  ive  implement  the  algorithm  by  use  pthread  with  jni  fftw  and  java  thread  from  jtransform  instead  of  get  a  better  perform  by  use  thread  as  expect  ive  got  better  result  use  serial  algorithm  it  is  unclear  to  me  whi  ive  got  those  result  sinc  id  execut  those  test  on  multicor  devic  it  seem  that  the  schedul  algorithm  use  by  android  system  is  kinda  differ  from  the  one  use  by  linux  and  your  out  of  luck  if  you  want  to  use  more  than  one  cpu  to  do  multiprocess  on  android  exampl  with  fftw  the  jni  code  is  in  and  it  interfac  is  the  method  call  in  test  is  execut  exampl  with  pure  java  here  the  method  call  is  perform  execut  and  perform  are  call  insid  anoth  thread  ,
