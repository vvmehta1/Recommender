 question  ,  null,  my  scenario  is  as  follow  i  am  implement  a  server  that  must  timeout  or  produc  a  respons  within  the  specifi  timeout  period  for  each  request  thus  each  request  is  ensur  a  respons  from  the  server  point  of  view  the  respons  of  cours  might  not  reach  the  client  due  to  transport  layer  failur  etc  in  order  to  implement  the  abov  semant  each  request  spawn  a  thread  actual  retriev  an  avail  one  from  a  thread  pool  and  await  it  respons  via  a  notifi  on  a  sync  object  the  wait  period  is  limit  with  a  timeout  param  sent  to  object  wait  method  the  spawn  thread  deleg  the  request  to  an  object  that  actual  know  how  to  handl  the  request  this  object  call  api  is  known  but  there  is  no  known  servic  level  agreement  which  would  specifi  that  a  call  will  never  hang  indefinit  specif  in  my  case  the  server  is  actual  a  corba  client  but  that  is  not  the  point  now  what  interest  me  is  whether  or  not  there  is  a  way  for  me  to  somehow  detect  that  that  thread  is  not  respons  and  then  kill  it  interrupt  it  even  though  i  am  current  block  on  a  method  call  by  the  way  i  know  that  i  can  keep  a  refer  to  the  thread  object  and  after  a  prespecifi  amount  of  time  call  it  interrupt  method  that  unfortun  doe  not  ensur  interrupt  semanticsthank  all  ,
