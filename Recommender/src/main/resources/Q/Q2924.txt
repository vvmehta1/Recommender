 question  ,  object  x  =  gogetxfromheap();  //  x.f  is  1  hereobject  y  =  gogetyfromheap();  //  y.f  is  11  hereobject  z  =  gogetzfromhead();  //  z.f  is  111  herey.f  =  12;synchronized(x){x.f  =  2;z.f  =  112;}//  will  only  x  be  flushed  on  exit  of  the  block?  //  will  the  update  to  y  get  flushed?//  will  the  update  to  z  get  flushed?  ,i  am  awar  that  the  purpos  of  volatil  variabl  in  java  is  that  write  to  such  variabl  are  immedi  visibl  to  other  thread  i  am  also  awar  that  one  of  the  effect  of  a  synchron  block  is  to  flush  threadloc  memori  to  global  memori  i  have  never  fulli  understood  the  refer  to  threadloc  memori  in  this  context  i  understand  that  data  which  onli  exist  on  the  stack  is  threadloc  but  when  talk  about  object  on  the  heap  my  understand  becom  hazyi  was  hope  that  to  get  comment  on  the  follow  point  overal  i  think  am  tri  to  understand  whether  threadloc  mean  memori  that  is  physic  access  by  onli  one  cpu  or  if  there  is  logic  threadloc  heap  partit  done  by  the  vm  ani  link  to  present  or  document  would  be  immens  help  i  have  spent  time  research  this  and  although  i  have  found  lot  of  nice  literatur  i  havent  been  abl  to  satisfi  my  curios  regard  the  differ  situat  definit  of  threadloc  memori  thank  veri  much  ,
