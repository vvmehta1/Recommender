 question  ,  boolean  subtree(treenode  t1'  '  treenode  t2)  {if  (t1  ==  null)  {return  false;}if  (t1.value  ==  t2.value)  {if  (treematch(t1'  '  t2))return  true;;}return  (subtree(t1.left'  '  t2)  ||  subtree(t1.right'  '  t2));}  ,im  look  at  some  java  algorithm  exampl  and  i  come  across  this  snippet  code  within  a  recurs  method  not  know  and  never  see  be  use  within  a  return  statement  befor  let  alon  a  recurs  one  realli  made  me  confus  i  copi  the  code  into  eclips  to  see  if  it  was  valid  and  it  was  i  then  replac  the  with  and  eclips  didnt  seem  bother  by  it  logic  i  understand  that  this  recurs  code  is  suppos  to  continu  down  the  left  and  right  subtre  of  treenod  t  but  im  look  for  a  more  theoret  explan  behind  how  this  java  syntax  work  can  someon  explain  the  mean  behind  and  within  java  return  statement  what  doe  it  mean  in  term  of  recurs  is  it  onli  meaning  when  use  in  conjunct  with  recurs  ,  returnstat  true  actualmethodparamet    actualmethodparamet     actualmethodparamet     actualmethodparamet  returnstat        actualmethodparamet     actualmethodparamet
