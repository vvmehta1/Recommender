 question  ,  null,  i  am  write  the  serversid  network  of  a  multiplay  game  the  game  is  an  rpg  and  it  has  the  absolut  maximum  capac  of  player  but  it  practic  will  max  out  at  about  player  although  it  may  be  higher  or  lower  for  the  longest  time  everi  time  i  had  to  do  network  where  it  involv  lot  of  client  i  have  stuck  to  nio  becaus  it  did  not  requir  the  use  of  hundr  of  thread  recent  i  ran  into  a  powerpoint  present  where  it  describ  the  two  model  in  detail  and  it  almost  made  the  threadpercli  model  seem  superior  to  nio  i  have  also  found  place  where  it  state  that  old  io  can  actual  outperform  nio  as  well  the  powerpoint  can  be  found  here  it  is  a  bit  old  i  have  not  written  ani  content  yet  so  it  would  not  be  a  problem  for  me  to  start  at  the  begin  if  i  had  to  chang  my  entir  network  design  i  am  not  pressur  for  time  initi  i  was  design  a  reactor  pattern  implement  with  nio  select  an  event  dispatch  a  handler  to  handl  the  eventmor  inform  can  be  found  heremi  entir  reactor  implement  is  design  to  use  a  singl  thread  sinc  i  read  that  old  io  can  outperform  it  actual  put  me  in  a  dilemma  i  do  not  want  to  design  a  complic  nio  system  that  use  multipl  thread  just  to  take  full  advantag  of  all  the  cpu  power  but  i  also  cring  at  the  idea  of  have  a  singl  applic  use  thread  which  design  is  right  for  my  purpos  the  advantag  of  thread  per  client  is  that  it  truli  use  har  all  of  the  cpu  power  by  natur  but  at  the  same  time  it  bog  down  the  system  not  to  mention  the  stack  size  of  a  singl  thread  take  up  a  lot  of  memori  when  multipli  by  a  coupl  hundr  time  should  i  stick  to  the  reactor  pattern  i  know  this  question  is  a  bit  ambigu  but  i  feel  that  i  need  to  ask  a  question  specif  for  my  situat  becaus  i  could  not  find  a  question  on  this  site  nor  a  websit  where  it  address  an  issu  of  my  sort  there  was  one  about  a  game  but  the  game  was  meant  to  handl  ten  of  thousand  of  player  thank  a  lot  if  you  need  ani  clarif  pleas  ask  ,
