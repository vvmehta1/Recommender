 question  ,  null,  i  know  list  make  thing  much  easier  in  java  instead  of  work  with  hardset  array  list  allow  you  to  addremov  element  at  will  and  they  automag  resiz  etc  ive  read  some  stuff  suggest  that  array  should  be  avoid  in  java  whenev  possibl  sinc  they  are  not  flexibl  at  all  and  sometim  can  impos  weird  limit  such  as  if  you  dont  know  the  size  an  array  need  to  be  etci  this  good  practic  to  stop  use  array  at  all  and  use  onli  list  logic  instead  im  sure  the  list  type  consum  more  memori  than  an  array  and  thus  have  higher  overhead  but  is  this  signific  most  list  would  be  gced  dure  runtim  if  they  are  left  lay  around  anyway  so  mayb  it  isnt  as  big  of  a  deal  as  im  think  ,    objectvari  simplevari  simpleassignmentexpress     objectvari  javautilarraylist  simplevari  simpleassignmentexpress
