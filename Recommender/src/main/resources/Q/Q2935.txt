 question  ,  "volatile;  //  broken  multithreaded  version//  ""double-checked  locking""  idiomclass  foo  {private  helper  helper  =  null;public  helper  gethelper()  {if  (helper  ==  null)  {synchronized(this)  {if  (helper  ==  null)  {helper  =  new  helper();}}}return  helper;}//  other  functions  and  members...};  helper  ==  null;  synchronized;  //  double-check  idiom  for  lazy  initialization  of  instance  fieldsprivate  volatile  fieldtype  field;fieldtype  getfield()  {fieldtype  result  =  field;if  (result  ==  null)  {  //  first  check  (no  locking)synchronized(this)  {result  =  field;if  (result  ==  null)  //  second  check  (with  locking)field  =  result  =  computefieldvalue();}}return  result;}"  ,i  found  the  follow  code  herei  am  tri  to  understand  whi  there  are  certain  case  where  this  would  not  work  i  read  the  explan  of  the  subtl  problem  and  that  use  will  fix  the  issu  but  im  a  bit  confus  basic  am  i  right  to  assum  this  would  fail  due  to  the  fact  that  the  check  in  the  block  has  a  chanc  to  fail  becaus  it  could  be  partial  construct  at  that  point  doe  java  return  null  if  an  object  is  partial  construct  is  that  the  issu  anyway  i  know  that  it  not  great  practic  to  do  doubl  check  lock  but  i  was  just  curious  in  theori  whi  the  abov  code  fail  and  whi  volatil  plus  the  addit  of  assign  a  local  variabl  fix  this  here  some  code  i  got  from  somewher  i  know  there  are  a  thousand  post  alreadi  about  this  but  explan  seem  to  mention  chang  in  memori  model  after  and  i  dont  quit  get  what  that  has  to  do  with  it  too  thank  in  advanc  ,
