 question  ,  null,  is  there  anyway  to  kill  a  thread  or  interrupt  it  immedi  like  in  one  of  my  thread  i  call  a  method  which  take  time  to  execut  second  this  method  is  in  a  whileboolean  flag  block  so  i  can  interrupt  it  from  the  main  thread  but  the  problem  is  if  i  interrupt  it  it  will  wait  till  the  execut  loop  is  finish  and  then  on  next  condit  check  it  will  stop  execut  i  want  it  to  stop  right  then  is  there  anyway  to  do  this  ,
