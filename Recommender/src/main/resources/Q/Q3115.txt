 question  ,  null,  my  applic  use  play  framework  to  process  rest  request  i  need  to  perform  some  potenti  long  last  block  io  oper  in  http  request  handler  in  parallel  id  like  to  handl  effici  some  short  last  request  as  describ  here  long  last  oper  can  be  run  asynchron  on  the  other  hand  as  describ  here  play  framework  use  the  same  default  thread  pool  in  which  all  applic  code  is  execut  at  least  in  java  api  there  is  no  possibl  to  run  asynchron  work  on  differ  thread  pool  so  my  question  is  if  it  worth  to  run  the  potenti  block  io  oper  asynchron  consid  the  fact  that  such  an  oper  use  the  same  thread  pool  anyway  or  mayb  it  better  to  increas  the  default  thread  pool  size  and  dont  bother  with  async  api  in  such  a  case  this  way  at  least  code  readabl  would  be  much  higher  ,
