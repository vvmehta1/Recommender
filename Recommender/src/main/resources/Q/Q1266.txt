 question  ,  foobar1.printfoo  ,i  have  half  a  dozen  class  which  all  extend  the  same  abstract  class  the  abstract  class  has  a  static  variabl  point  to  some  jni  code  that  i  onli  want  to  load  onc  per  instanti  of  the  class  from  what  i  understand  this  result  in  exact  one  instanc  of  this  static  variabl  be  instanti  but  what  i  want  is  for  each  of  the  extend  class  to  have  their  own  static  instanc  of  the  variabl  that  is  uniqu  for  the  given  child  class  i  want  to  write  some  code  in  my  abstract  class  that  modifi  andor  releas  the  abstract  class  is  it  possibl  to  do  both  of  these  thing  at  onc  so  as  an  exampl  can  i  write  an  abstract  class  bar  with  an  variabl  fooand  a  printfoo  method  which  print  the  content  of  foo  then  i  instanti  in  orderfoobar  foobar  and  foobar  which  each  extend  the  bar  class  and  initi  foo  to  differ  valu  in  static  block  if  i  call  i  want  to  print  the  static  valu  of  foo  initi  by  foobar  constructor  can  this  be  done  in  java  ,  simpleassignmentexpress
