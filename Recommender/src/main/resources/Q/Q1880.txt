 question  ,  null,  pretti  soon  now  were  gonna  need  to  develop  a  gui  for  creat  configur  more  like  script  to  be  honest  for  our  eai  solut  at  work  think  of  a  typic  workflow  editor  the  visual  of  the  actual  flow  will  most  like  be  a  complet  custom  job  either  in  swing  swt  or  javafx  what  i  have  troubl  with  choos  is  whether  to  do  everyth  els  by  ourselv  or  use  a  rich  client  platform  in  particular  ive  notic  that  javafx  is  get  a  lot  of  attent  and  seem  to  be  realli  push  by  oracl  as  the  next  big  thing  in  the  java  gui  landscap  the  demonstr  look  interest  and  perhap  this  newer  api  is  more  close  focus  on  product  as  oppos  to  the  ton  of  boilerpl  code  that  swing  tend  to  impos  use  a  newer  technolog  that  get  a  lot  of  support  seem  like  a  safe  bet  for  futur  mainten  use  an  rcp  would  have  definit  benefit  for  this  project  whether  we  go  for  eclips  or  netbean  as  the  platform  have  exist  pluginsmodul  for  view  the  under  xml  config  version  control  etc  would  offer  power  function  with  minim  work  i  also  like  the  idea  of  have  project  type  of  our  softwar  next  to  java  project  in  the  same  gui  even  simpl  stuff  like  window  manag  and  custom  arrang  panel  is  much  better  handl  by  rcps  that  what  we  could  whip  up  so  the  question  now  is  what  technolog  or  combin  thereof  is  viabl  my  option  as  far  as  i  can  see  are  thus  basic  my  onli  gui  experi  is  in  swing  on  small  app  this  is  the  first  time  ill  be  go  for  someth  that  would  warrant  a  rcp  but  javafx  seem  the  way  forward  and  i  dont  want  to  miss  the  boat  on  that  one  if  swing  might  be  on  the  way  out  id  prefer  hop  onboard  the  newer  technolog  if  there  are  peopl  who  can  share  their  experi  have  tri  someth  like  netbean  javafx  or  are  closer  to  the  forefront  of  javafx  and  can  recommenddiscourag  it  use  for  this  sort  of  thing  id  be  most  interest  i  realiz  it  a  somewhat  open  question  but  i  cant  realli  think  of  a  more  appropri  place  im  not  look  for  a  what  the  best  rcp  is  javafx  better  than  swing  debat  im  look  for  valid  point  foragainst  their  use  in  this  context  ,
