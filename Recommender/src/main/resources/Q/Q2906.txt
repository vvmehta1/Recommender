 question  ,  "public  class  foo  {public  void  executeblaalotoftimes()  {long  before  =  system.currenttimemillis();for  (int  i  =  0;  i<40000;  i++)  {executebla();}long  after  =  system.currenttimemillis();  system.out.println(""time  it  took  for  a  lot  of  bla  to  execute:  ""  +  (after  -  before)  /  1000.0  +  ""  seconds."");}};  @servicepublic  class  bar  {@asyncpublic  void  executebla()  {system.out.println(""bla!"");}}"  ,i  have  an  applic  where  for  a  certain  number  of  time  someth  need  to  be  calcul  this  calcul  function  has  the  annot  async  from  the  spring  framework  that  make  it  possibl  to  run  these  calcul  on  thread  the  problem  is  that  i  need  about  of  these  calcul  and  i  want  to  know  the  time  between  the  start  and  end  of  all  the  calcul  so  i  see  what  time  it  is  befor  and  after  the  forloop  that  call  the  calcul  function  but  now  all  the  calcul  are  put  in  a  queue  so  the  for  loop  finish  immedi  and  the  time  is  someth  like  second  while  it  take  a  coupl  of  hour  for  the  calcul  to  complet  ive  tri  set  a  max  queue  size  to  about  also  good  to  reduc  memori  usag  but  this  is  also  no  solut  sinc  ill  miss  the  last  calcul  in  the  total  time  it  take  is  there  a  way  to  paus  the  execut  code  just  after  the  for  loop  until  all  thread  have  finish  do  their  work  but  still  be  abl  to  use  the  async  annot  this  is  some  code  that  illustr  the  same  problem  execut  class  and  the  class  that  perform  the  calcul  this  would  result  in  the  follow  output  assum  the  code  in  foo  execut  infinit  fast  ,
