 question  ,  null,  im  curious  as  to  what  exact  the  differ  is  between  javafxconcur  and  platformrunlat  for  multithread  javafx  program  doe  it  mean  that  with  javafxconcurr  we  can  have  multipl  actual  draw  thread  or  doe  it  all  end  up  on  one  thread  anyway  eg  one  thing  i  enjoy  was  use  javafx  and  swing  concurr  as  they  both  use  differ  draw  thread  i  would  use  swing  for  the  heavi  stuff  eg  open  a  filechoos  and  use  javafx  for  the  core  visual  stuff  eg  play  a  seamless  loop  video  howev  the  mac  make  this  imposs  becaus  of  that  headless  except  error  so  everyth  fell  on  javafx  and  that  meant  a  lot  of  paus  when  do  thing  like  open  filechoos  if  i  rewrit  my  app  with  javafxconcurr  could  i  essenti  mimic  that  draw  thread  experi  as  i  onc  did  with  swing  javafx  ,
