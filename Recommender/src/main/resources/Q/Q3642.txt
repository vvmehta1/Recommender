 question  ,  bitmapfactory.decodestream;  bitmap  bitmap  =  bitmapfactory.decodestream(new  url(imgurl).openconnection().getinputstream()'  '  null'  '  someunrelatedoptions);;  bitmapfactory;  workerthread.interrupt();  thread.currentthread().isinterrupted();  bitmapfactory;  inputstream;  filterinputstream;  ioexception;  bitmapfactory;  inputstream;  close();  ioexception;  progressbar  ,let  assum  we  have  a  worker  thread  which  call  with  some  connect  stream  like  this  now  we  need  to  termin  this  thread  immediet  in  order  to  reclaim  ani  memori  that  has  alloc  we  cant  wait  for  it  to  finish  for  too  long  as  the  memori  is  requir  by  ui  thread  the  exampl  is  simplifi  so  let  dont  go  into  detail  whi  it  has  to  be  done  this  way  im  look  for  a  solut  to  this  approach  not  for  anoth  approach  we  cant  brutal  kill  the  thread  as  it  do  some  other  thing  too  and  there  a  chanc  we  will  leak  some  stuff  the  onli  clean  way  to  go  is  to  use  unfortunet  the  bitmapfactori  doesnt  care  whether  the  thread  was  interrupt  and  continu  to  do  it  work  obvious  im  check  the  right  after  it  exist  but  it  not  suffici  on  realli  slow  internet  connect  it  may  take  year  to  load  the  imag  which  will  freez  the  applic  rememb  ui  thread  is  wait  so  the  question  is  how  do  i  make  stop  when  the  thread  is  interrupt  my  idea  is  to  wrap  the  in  custom  overwrit  everi  function  there  arent  mani  actual  and  in  each  of  them  check  whether  the  thread  is  interrupt  if  yes  throw  some  this  way  will  stop  as  soon  as  it  tri  to  pull  some  data  from  the  and  it  should  be  enough  are  there  ani  better  way  if  no  should  i  call  on  the  stream  befor  throw  and  a  littl  note  the  ui  thread  that  is  wait  for  addit  memori  is  display  a  nice  so  it  not  a  problem  if  it  take  a  second  or  two  for  the  worker  thread  to  termin  thank  ,  simpleassignmentexpress
