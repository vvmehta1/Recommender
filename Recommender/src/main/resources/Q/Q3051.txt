 question  ,  ai;  ai;  jvm;  api;  securitymanager;  ai;  ai;  ai;  thread.interrupt();  thread.stop();  threaddeath;  jvm;  jvm  ,we  run  an  program  competit  in  which  contest  will  code  an  that  run  on  the  use  our  we  provid  them  we  put  them  into  a  sandbox  by  limit  what  they  can  do  with  a  and  dure  runtim  they  simpli  set  sever  flag  which  are  their  decis  the  onli  interact  between  our  system  and  their  is  through  these  flag  so  there  are  no  bad  effect  on  us  if  their  thread  were  to  sudden  die  when  an  comput  far  too  long  we  would  like  to  shut  down  their  thread  howev  we  cant  find  a  way  of  guarante  that  we  will  destroy  their  thread  one  possibl  reason  for  this  is  that  the  goe  into  an  infinit  loop  with  no  block  make  useless  is  unreli  sinc  if  they  are  in  a  tri  catch  block  the  except  will  be  caught  and  has  no  issu  for  us  becaus  they  dont  touch  anyth  bad  and  we  dont  care  if  they  die  current  we  just  ignor  their  thread  and  continu  on  without  them  after  they  time  out  but  their  infinit  loop  will  continu  process  in  the  background  until  the  die  this  is  unaccept  to  us  becaus  we  will  be  run  match  in  the  background  on  a  web  server  so  we  want  as  much  stabil  as  possibl  one  thought  has  been  to  run  each  game  in  a  separ  but  that  is  far  more  complex  than  we  would  like  to  get  is  there  ani  sure  fire  way  to  destroy  the  thread  ,  objectvari  simplevari  objectmethodinvoc  simpleassignmentexpress       multiplyexpress
