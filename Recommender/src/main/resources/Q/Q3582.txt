 question  ,  servicefactoy  ,assum  i  have  bundl  and  bundl  is  the  start  point  of  my  applic  bundl  provid  the  api  of  the  servic  use  by  bundl  is  an  implement  of  the  servic  basic  bundl  has  a  set  of  record  that  it  process  one  after  the  other  there  is  no  order  for  process  the  record  i  would  like  to  improv  perform  of  my  applic  by  process  subset  of  record  concurr  i  thought  about  two  differ  way  multipl  instanc  of  bundl  a  and  bundl  a  with  multipl  thread  afaik  it  is  not  possibl  to  add  multipl  instanc  of  the  same  bundl  ie  same  osgi  ident  in  an  osgi  contain  regard  the  second  possibl  each  thread  creat  by  bundl  would  have  it  own  ident  and  the  servic  export  by  need  to  know  the  ident  of  the  thread  that  use  it  thus  i  thought  a  would  fit  here  howev  ive  read  that  onc  a  servic  instanc  is  obtain  by  a  bundl  it  is  cach  therefor  all  the  thread  would  get  the  same  servic  instanc  am  i  right  if  yes  what  is  the  right  way  to  implement  this  model  feel  free  to  propos  me  a  complet  differ  approach  that  is  more  osgi  friend  thanksmickael  anoth  possibl  would  be  to  modifi  the  servic  interfac  to  allow  the  servic  consum  to  pass  their  ident  to  the  servic  the  servic  would  then  becom  stateless  and  the  use  of  servicefactori  would  not  be  requir  howev  the  fact  the  ident  is  requir  is  an  implement  detail  ie  it  is  requir  onli  for  this  specif  implement  therefor  for  futur  implement  the  paramet  ad  to  the  interfac  would  not  be  use  this  is  whi  i  prefer  not  to  touch  the  interfac  ,  simpleassignmentexpress
