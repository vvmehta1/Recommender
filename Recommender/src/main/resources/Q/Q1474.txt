 question  ,  null,  tri  to  understand  a  question  i  got  wrong  on  a  test  how  doe  inherit  differ  from  implement  interfac  the  way  i  was  think  is  that  interfac  defin  behavior  while  superclass  defin  characterist  or  are  they  the  same  or  am  i  complet  backward  in  my  understand  edit  i  guess  i  should  specifi  that  i  know  the  differ  between  interfac  and  inherit  im  just  wonder  about  the  two  option  which  use  the  term  i  dont  know  if  the  prof  was  nitpick  about  terminolog  or  if  he  ask  the  question  poor  i  know  that  when  you  implement  an  interfac  you  have  to  implement  all  the  method  as  defin  in  the  interfac  as  such  i  would  say  that  the  interfac  defin  the  behavior  that  a  class  have  but  extend  anoth  superclass  although  it  doe  also  defin  some  behavior  more  can  be  given  to  the  subclass  it  doesnt  seem  to  fit  as  strong  as  the  interfac  defin  behavior  if  the  class  implement  an  interfac  you  can  be  sure  that  it  has  certain  behavior  mayb  the  question  was  meant  to  ask  whether  or  not  the  interfac  itself  has  the  code  for  the  behavior  or  if  it  just  the  definit  which  if  word  that  way  i  would  have  known  the  answer  ,
