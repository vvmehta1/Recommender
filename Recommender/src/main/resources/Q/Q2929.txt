 question  ,  null,  im  current  work  on  a  rather  larg  pet  project  of  mine  a  swing  applic  that  by  it  veri  natur  need  to  be  multithread  almost  all  user  interact  might  fetch  data  from  some  remot  server  over  the  internet  sinc  i  neither  control  these  server  nor  the  internet  itself  long  respons  time  are  thus  inevit  a  swing  ui  obvious  cannot  repaint  itself  while  the  edt  is  busi  so  all  remot  server  call  need  to  be  execut  by  background  thread  my  problem  data  fetch  by  the  background  thread  get  enrich  with  data  from  a  local  inmemori  databas  remot  server  return  idsrefer  to  data  in  the  local  databas  this  data  later  eventu  get  pass  to  the  edt  where  it  becom  part  of  the  view  model  some  entiti  are  not  complet  initi  at  this  point  lazyfetch  enabl  so  the  user  might  trigger  lazyfetch  by  eg  scroll  in  a  jtabl  sinc  the  hibern  session  is  alreadi  close  this  will  trigger  a  lazyinitializationexcept  i  cant  know  when  lazyfetch  might  be  trigger  by  the  user  so  creat  a  session  on  demandattach  the  detach  object  will  not  work  here  i  solv  this  problem  by  while  this  work  the  applic  perform  has  suffer  great  sometim  be  close  to  unus  the  slowdown  is  main  caus  by  the  larg  number  of  object  that  are  now  fetch  by  each  queri  im  current  think  about  chang  the  applic  design  to  sessionperthread  and  migrat  all  entiti  fetch  by  nonedt  thread  to  the  edt  thread  session  similar  to  sidenot  ani  problem  relat  to  databas  updat  do  not  appli  sinc  all  databas  entiti  are  readon  refer  data  ani  other  idea  on  how  to  use  hibern  lazyload  in  this  scenario  ,
