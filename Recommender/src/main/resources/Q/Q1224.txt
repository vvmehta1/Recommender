 question  ,  null,  i  know  the  question  has  been  but  it  seem  alway  under  the  assumpt  that  inherit  is  at  least  sometim  prefer  to  composit  id  like  to  challeng  that  assumpt  in  hope  of  gain  some  understand  my  question  is  this  you  can  accomplish  anyth  with  object  composit  that  you  can  with  classic  inherit  classic  inherit  is  veri  often  abus  object  composit  give  you  flexibl  to  chang  the  deleg  object  runtimei  can  sort  of  understand  whi  you  would  recommend  inherit  in  some  languag  like  java  and  c  that  do  not  offer  conveni  syntax  for  deleg  in  these  languag  you  can  save  a  lot  of  type  by  use  inherit  whenev  it  is  not  clear  incorrect  to  do  so  but  other  languag  like  object  c  and  rubi  offer  both  classic  inherit  veri  convieni  syntax  for  deleg  the  go  program  languag  is  the  onli  langag  that  to  my  knowledg  has  decid  that  classic  inherit  is  more  troubl  than  it  worth  and  support  onli  deleg  for  code  reuseanoth  way  to  state  my  question  is  this  even  if  you  know  that  classic  inherit  is  not  incorrect  to  implement  a  certain  model  is  that  reason  enough  to  use  it  instead  of  composit  mani  peopl  use  classic  inherit  to  achiev  polymorph  instead  of  let  their  class  implement  an  interfac  the  purpos  of  inherit  is  code  reus  not  polymorph  furthermor  some  peopl  use  inherit  to  model  their  intuit  understand  of  an  isa  relationship  i  just  want  to  clarifi  what  i  mean  exact  when  i  talk  about  inherit  i  am  talk  about  i  am  talk  about  inherit  from  a  pure  abstract  base  class  which  amount  to  the  same  thing  as  implement  an  interfac  which  i  for  the  record  am  not  argu  against  i  understand  that  inherit  is  the  onli  way  to  achiev  polymorph  i  c  in  that  case  it  obvious  whi  you  must  use  it  so  my  question  is  limit  to  languag  such  as  java  or  rubi  that  offer  distinct  way  to  achiev  polymorph  interfac  and  duck  type  respect  ,                simpleassignmentexpress  classdefinit  publicclassspecifi  formalmethodparamet  methoddefinit  publicmethodspecifi  staticmethodspecifi  switchstat  caseclaus  defaultclaus  returnstat  objectcreationstat  constructorcal  throwstat  actualmethodparamet  stringliter  stringdatatyp  objectvari  simplevari  voiddatatyp              simpleassignmentexpress  instancefield  simplevari  actualmethodparamet  objectvari     simpleassignmentexpress
