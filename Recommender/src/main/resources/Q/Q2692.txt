 question  ,  myrunnable  implements  runnable  {@overridepublic  void  run()  {try  {thread.sleep(30000);}  catch  (interruptedexception  e1)  {e1.printstacktrace();}  ,i  have  a  singlethreadexecutor  in  order  to  execut  the  task  i  submit  to  it  in  serial  order  ie  one  task  after  anoth  no  parallel  execut  i  have  runnabl  which  goe  someth  like  this  when  i  submit  for  exampl  three  instanc  of  myrunn  to  the  aforement  singl  thread  executor  i  would  expect  to  have  the  first  task  execut  and  becaus  of  the  threadsleep  has  it  execut  thread  in  timedwait  i  may  be  wrong  about  the  specif  state  the  other  two  task  should  not  have  thread  assign  to  execut  them  at  least  not  until  the  first  task  has  finish  so  my  question  is  how  to  get  this  state  via  the  futuretask  api  or  somehow  get  to  the  thread  that  is  execut  the  task  if  there  is  no  such  thread  then  the  task  is  wait  to  be  execut  or  pend  and  get  it  state  or  perhap  by  some  other  meansfuturetask  onli  defin  iscancel  and  isdon  method  but  those  are  not  quit  enough  to  describ  all  the  possibl  execut  status  of  the  task  ,  classdefinit  publicclassspecifi  methoddefinit  publicmethodspecifi  voiddatatyp    simpleassignmentexpress  true  objectmethodinvoc  fals  booleandatatyp  returnstat        objectmethodinvoc  ifstat  notequalexpress  null  javalangsystemoutprintln  actualmethodparamet  stringliter  stringdatatyp  simpleassignmentexpress  stringaddit  instancefield  simplevari
