 question  ,  "regexpthread  rt  =  new  regexpthread()  {public  void  run()  {method  2(m'  '  urlcopy'  '  document);}};rt.start();try  {rt.join(6  *  1000);}  catch  (interruptedexception  e)  {return  ""y"";}if(rt.getresultxml().equals(""""))  {return  ""g"";}resultxml.append(rt.getresultxml());return  resultxml.tostring();"  ,i  am  run  a  regex  in  a  java  function  to  pars  a  document  and  return  true  if  it  has  found  the  string  specifi  by  the  regex  and  return  fals  if  it  hasnt  but  the  problem  is  that  when  the  document  doesnt  contain  the  string  specifi  by  the  regex  it  take  a  veri  long  time  to  return  fals  and  i  want  to  termin  that  function  if  it  take  more  than  second  to  execut  how  can  i  set  a  time  limit  of  second  on  that  function  so  as  to  forcibl  termin  that  if  it  take  more  than  second  i  am  call  a  method  method  of  class  from  class  the  method  call  method  of  the  same  class  ie  class  method  run  the  regex  code  over  a  document  if  it  find  the  string  specifi  by  the  regex  then  it  return  the  result  to  the  method  which  in  turn  return  the  result  to  the  method  in  class  which  call  the  method  of  class  now  the  problem  is  that  the  execut  time  of  both  the  method  and  method  of  class  should  be  not  more  than  second  so  i  made  a  new  regexpthread  class  in  the  same  file  in  which  my  class  was  then  i  move  the  method  of  the  class  into  class  regexpthread  then  whenev  the  method  is  call  it  instanti  the  regexpthread  class  as  follow  the  code  shown  is  in  the  method  of  class  the  method  in  the  regexpthread  class  perform  some  regex  search  over  a  document  there  is  a  privat  field  name  resultxml  in  the  regexpthread  class  if  the  method  has  found  the  string  specifi  by  the  regex  then  it  assign  the  result  to  the  privat  field  resultxml  if  not  then  the  resultxml  contain  it  default  valu  ie  empti  string  so  in  the  abov  if  block  it  is  check  the  resultxml  field  against  empti  string  if  it  is  an  empti  string  then  that  mean  the  regex  has  not  found  it  string  in  the  document  but  if  it  is  not  an  empti  string  then  that  mean  the  regex  has  found  the  string  in  the  document  and  has  assign  the  result  to  the  resultxml  field  so  look  at  this  and  tell  me  what  to  do  ,  simpleassignmentexpress  instancefield  simplevari  returnstat  stringliter  stringdatatyp    simpleassignmentexpress     objectvari  simplevari  objectmethodinvoc              objectvari  simplevari  simpleassignmentexpress        stringdatatyp
