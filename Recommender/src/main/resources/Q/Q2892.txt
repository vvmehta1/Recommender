 question  ,  null,  i  have  a  piec  of  java  code  jdk  if  relev  that  implement  a  stateless  side  effect  free  function  with  no  mutex  it  doe  howev  use  a  lot  of  memori  i  dont  know  if  that  is  relev  in  the  past  i  have  visit  sun  laboratori  and  gather  the  standard  perform  vs  number  of  thread  curv  as  this  function  has  no  mutex  it  has  a  nice  graph  although  the  garbag  collect  kick  in  as  the  number  of  thread  increas  after  some  garbag  collect  tune  i  was  abl  to  make  this  curv  almost  flat  i  am  now  do  the  same  experi  on  intel  hardwar  the  hardwar  has  cpus  each  with  core  and  hyperthread  this  give  availableprocessor  unfortun  the  curv  of  perform  vs  number  of  thread  scale  nice  for  thread  and  cap  at  thread  after  thread  i  can  put  as  mani  thread  as  i  want  to  the  task  and  the  perform  get  no  better  my  first  thought  was  that  i  had  been  stupid  and  introduc  some  synchronis  code  somewher  normal  to  resolv  this  issu  i  run  jconsol  or  jvisualvm  and  look  at  the  thread  stacktrac  if  i  have  thread  run  at  the  speed  of  i  would  expect  of  them  to  be  sit  wait  to  enter  a  mutex  i  didnt  find  this  instead  i  found  all  the  thread  run  just  veri  slowli  a  second  thought  was  that  perhap  the  time  framework  was  introduc  problem  i  replac  my  function  with  a  dummi  function  that  just  count  to  a  billion  use  an  atomiclong  this  scale  beauti  with  number  of  thread  i  was  abl  to  count  to  a  billion  time  time  quicker  with  with  thread  than  with  thread  i  thought  desper  kick  in  perhap  garbag  collect  is  take  a  realli  realli  long  time  so  i  tweak  the  garbag  collect  paramet  while  this  improv  my  latenc  variat  it  had  no  effect  on  throughput  i  still  have  thread  run  at  the  speed  i  expect  to  run  at  i  have  download  the  intel  tool  vtune  but  my  skill  with  it  is  weak  it  is  a  complex  tool  and  i  dont  understand  it  yet  i  have  the  instruct  book  on  order  a  fun  christma  present  to  myself  but  that  is  a  littl  too  late  to  help  my  current  problem  ,
