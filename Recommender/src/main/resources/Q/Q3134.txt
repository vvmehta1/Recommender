 question  ,  parallelworkiterator<result>  itr  =  new  parallelworkiterator<result>(trials'  'threads)  {public  result  work()  {//do  work  here  for  a  single  trial...return  answer;}};while  (itr.hasnext())  {result  result  =  itr.next();//process  result...}  ,im  look  for  a  class  where  i  can  overrid  a  method  to  do  the  work  and  return  the  result  like  an  iter  someth  like  this  this  is  main  go  to  be  use  for  thing  like  mont  carlo  simul  but  i  dont  want  to  have  to  deal  with  set  up  thread  pool  and  manag  return  thread  everi  time  i  roll  my  own  class  that  accomplish  this  but  im  not  confid  enough  in  it  and  thought  id  check  if  someth  like  this  alreadi  exist  edit  to  be  clear  i  want  it  to  keep  run  in  the  background  and  queu  result  after  each  work  method  return  until  all  trial  have  been  complet  so  the  next  method  may  wait  to  return  until  there  is  a  result  in  the  queue  ,
