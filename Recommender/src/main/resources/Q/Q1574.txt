 question  ,  `public  interface  database  {public  object  createnode(...);public  void  modifynode(object  id'  '  ...);...  }`public  class  database1  {  @overridepublic  object  createnode(...)  {  ...long  result  =  //  obtain  id  of  created  nodereturn  long.valueof(result);}@overridepublic  void  modifynode(object  id'  '  ...)  {  ...//  use  id  as  ((long)id).longvalue();}}public  class  database2  {  @overridepublic  object  createnode(...)  {  ...someobject  result  =  //  obtain  id  of  created  nodereturn  result;}@overridepublic  void  modifynode(object  id'  '  ...)  {  ...//  use  id  as  (someobject)id}}  ,i  am  look  for  a  good  way  to  have  differ  implement  of  the  same  method  which  is  defin  in  an  interfac  but  with  differ  paramet  type  would  this  be  possibl  in  order  to  clarifi  this  suppos  i  have  an  interfac  databas  and  two  implement  class  databas  and  databas  databas  has  a  method  createnod  and  anoth  one  modifynod  the  problem  is  that  for  databas  the  return  type  of  the  createnod  method  should  be  a  long  the  identifi  for  databas  howev  it  would  be  an  object  specif  from  the  technolog  in  this  case  orientdb  but  this  doesnt  matter  too  much  it  is  simpli  someth  that  extend  object  of  cours  and  also  both  creat  return  type  should  be  use  as  one  of  modifynod  paramet  what  i  was  think  to  do  is  i  want  to  know  if  there  is  a  better  way  to  do  this  special  to  avoid  long  long  and  long  long  convers  i  saw  mani  similar  question  here  in  stackoverflow  but  none  of  them  were  what  i  was  look  for  thank  you  veri  much  in  advanc  ,
