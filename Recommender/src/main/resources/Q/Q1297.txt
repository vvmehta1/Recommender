 question  ,  null,  i  have  the  capabl  to  extend  a  class  at  compil  time  but  i  need  to  be  abl  to  creat  an  instanc  of  this  subclass  at  runtim  use  an  instanc  of  the  superclass  that  was  alreadi  instanti  this  should  be  possibl  in  theori  becaus  superclass  constructor  are  alreadi  call  befor  the  subclass  constructor  i  do  not  have  access  to  the  program  suffici  to  chang  the  instanti  to  my  subclass  nor  to  interrupt  the  origin  instanti  use  case  there  is  an  exist  array  of  instanc  of  class  x  my  code  is  load  in  after  i  need  to  overrid  one  of  the  method  of  one  of  the  instanc  x  with  my  load  subclass  y  extend  x  the  parent  program  access  the  object  onli  through  that  array  so  i  want  to  replac  that  array  element  with  my  y  instanc  but  it  need  to  behav  as  if  it  were  instanti  origin  into  that  array  i  cannot  just  enclos  the  superclass  instanc  and  forward  call  and  there  are  difficult  complic  with  reinstanti  the  superclass  i  hope  that  is  more  clear  ,
