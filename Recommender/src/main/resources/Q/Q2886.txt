 question  ,  public  class  sircountalot  {public  static  void  main(string[]  args)  {int  count  =  0;while  (true)  {count++;}}}  ,say  i  run  a  simpl  singlethread  process  like  the  one  below  this  is  java  becaus  that  what  im  familiar  with  but  i  suspect  it  doesnt  realli  matter  i  have  an  i  processor  core  or  count  hyperthread  and  im  run  window  bit  so  i  fire  up  sysintern  process  explor  to  look  at  the  cpu  usag  and  as  expect  i  see  it  is  use  around  of  all  avail  cpu  but  when  i  toggl  the  option  to  show  graph  per  cpu  i  see  that  instead  of  of  the  core  be  use  the  cpu  usag  is  spread  all  over  the  core  instead  what  i  would  expect  is  core  max  out  but  this  onli  happen  when  i  set  the  affin  for  the  process  to  a  singl  core  whi  is  the  workload  split  over  the  separ  core  wouldnt  split  the  workload  over  sever  core  mess  with  the  cach  or  incur  other  perform  penalti  is  it  for  the  simpl  reason  of  prevent  overh  of  one  core  or  is  there  some  deeper  reasonim  awar  that  the  oper  system  is  respons  for  the  schedul  but  i  want  to  know  whi  it  bother  sure  from  a  naiv  viewpoint  stick  a  most  singlethread  process  to  core  is  the  simpler  more  effici  way  to  go  i  say  most  singlethread  becaus  there  multipl  thead  here  but  onli  of  them  are  do  anyth  ,  classdefinit  publicclassspecifi  formalmethodparamet  methoddefinit  publicmethodspecifi  staticmethodspecifi  voiddatatyp  intdatatyp  simpleassignmentexpress  whilestat  true  postincrementexpress
