 question  ,  null,  my  team  built  a  java  applic  use  the  hadoop  librari  to  transform  a  bunch  of  input  file  into  use  outputgiven  the  current  load  a  singl  multicor  server  will  do  fine  for  the  come  year  or  so  we  do  not  yet  have  the  need  to  go  for  a  multiserv  hadoop  cluster  yet  we  chose  to  start  this  project  be  prepar  when  i  run  this  app  on  the  commandlin  or  in  eclips  or  netbean  i  have  not  yet  been  abl  to  convinc  it  to  use  more  that  one  map  andor  reduc  thread  at  a  timegiven  the  fact  that  the  tool  is  veri  cpu  intens  this  singl  threaded  is  my  current  bottleneck  when  run  it  in  the  netbean  profil  i  do  see  that  the  app  start  sever  thread  for  various  purpos  but  onli  a  singl  mapreduc  is  run  at  the  same  moment  the  input  data  consist  of  sever  input  file  so  hadoop  should  at  least  be  abl  to  run  thread  per  input  file  at  the  same  time  for  the  map  phase  what  do  i  do  to  at  least  have  or  even  activ  thread  run  which  should  be  possibl  for  most  of  the  process  time  of  this  applic  im  expect  this  to  be  someth  veri  silli  that  ive  overlook  i  just  found  this  this  implement  the  featur  i  was  look  for  in  hadoop  it  introduc  the  flag  mapreducelocalmaptasksmaximum  to  control  it  for  now  ive  also  found  the  solut  describ  ,       simpleassignmentexpress
