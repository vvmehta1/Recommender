 question  ,  //number  of  threadspublic  static  final  int  threads  =runtime.getruntime().availableprocessors();  ,i  recent  inherit  a  small  java  program  that  take  inform  from  a  larg  databas  doe  some  process  and  produc  a  detail  imag  regard  the  inform  the  origin  author  wrote  the  code  use  a  singl  thread  then  later  modifi  it  to  allow  it  to  use  multipl  threadsin  the  code  he  defin  a  constant  which  then  set  the  number  of  thread  that  are  use  to  creat  the  imag  i  understand  his  reason  that  the  number  of  thread  cannot  be  greater  than  the  number  of  avail  processor  so  set  it  the  the  amount  to  get  the  full  potenti  out  of  the  processor  is  this  correct  or  is  there  a  better  way  to  util  the  full  potenti  of  the  processor  edit  to  give  some  more  clarif  the  specif  algorithm  that  is  be  thread  scale  to  the  resolut  of  the  pictur  be  creat  thread  per  pixel  that  is  obvious  not  the  best  solut  though  the  work  that  this  algorithm  doe  is  what  take  all  the  time  and  is  wholli  mathemat  oper  there  are  no  lock  or  other  factor  that  will  caus  ani  given  thread  to  sleep  i  just  want  to  maxim  the  program  cpu  util  to  decreas  the  time  to  complet  ,
