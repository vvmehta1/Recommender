 question  ,  null,  i  have  implement  gui  use  swing  and  alway  tri  to  follow  the  mvc  pattern  as  much  as  i  could  i  was  wonder  though  if  mvc  is  not  the  onli  part  of  the  puzzl  are  fsms  use  in  gui  design  as  well  i  have  never  use  an  fsm  in  a  gui  and  my  approach  was  on  action  the  correspond  method  of  the  control  was  call  to  endup  updat  the  model  finish  with  updat  the  view  usual  upon  a  request  trigger  by  a  user  action  i  use  some  simpl  check  to  make  sure  that  the  user  should  be  abl  to  do  the  action  of  the  kindi  a  specif  compon  enabl  or  is  the  label  visibl  of  this  kind  etc  this  seem  to  work  so  far  but  i  have  to  admit  that  i  was  lucki  and  did  not  have  to  build  too  complicatedsophist  or  elabor  gui  i  have  build  fsms  befor  in  differ  kind  off  applic  main  in  c  and  i  start  to  wonder  if  fsms  in  gui  is  actual  use  as  a  pattern  and  my  approach  ie  to  make  check  on  actionlisten  code  on  what  the  user  see  plus  what  compon  are  enabl  or  disabl  etc  to  determin  if  the  user  should  see  some  error  messag  instead  of  be  abl  to  do  the  specif  action  that  eg  the  button  promis  is  actual  a  bad  idea  for  fullfledg  gui  app  so  when  start  to  design  a  gui  besid  how  to  implement  the  mvc  do  you  fitassoci  an  fsm  in  your  design  after  review  dhruv  gairola  articl  in  his  comment  i  am  still  puzzl  on  this  the  articl  mention  build  an  fsm  which  is  though  actual  bind  to  the  calcul  implement  mean  that  even  if  the  calcul  was  implement  get  user  input  without  a  gui  but  via  the  command  line  the  fsm  would  still  be  need  i  am  still  not  sure  if  fsms  to  valid  user  action  on  each  point  in  time  is  a  popular  or  valid  design  it  seem  that  it  could  be  too  much  effort  and  requir  that  the  gui  has  been  design  complet  in  advanc  and  all  the  possibl  user  action  have  been  map  to  specif  result  depend  on  specif  state  given  the  fact  that  there  has  no  been  ani  comment  just  a  one  repli  i  am  tend  to  think  that  may  be  fsms  to  valid  a  user  action  on  control  are  actual  not  use  ani  input  on  this  is  high  welcom  thank  you  ,
