 question  ,  x;  x;  x;  y;  x;  y;  volatile;  volatile  ,i  use  to  think  there  are  onli  two  multithread  hazard  i  figur  that  if  i  can  reason  these  thing  cant  happen  i  dont  need  to  synchron  but  from  i  learn  there  can  be  other  hazard  from  how  the  compil  the  cpu  and  the  memori  work  behind  the  scene  i  now  work  on  an  android  project  and  onc  again  i  face  a  similar  problem  i  can  reason  about  some  function  be  safe  from  race  condit  and  unstabl  state  but  not  about  those  three  behindthescen  hazard  ive  encount  the  java  member  field  and  from  what  i  gather  it  use  memori  barrier  to  prevent  the  cpu  from  mess  with  order  of  executionand  obvious  the  compil  wont  mess  with  it  if  it  prevent  the  cpu  from  do  so  so  it  should  solv  the  first  hazard  but  what  about  the  other  two  in  other  word  if  i  can  reason  that  race  condit  and  unstabl  state  are  not  a  problem  and  mark  the  share  variabl  as  is  it  safe  to  not  use  synchron  ,  objectvari  simplevari
